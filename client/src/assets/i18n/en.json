      "SLOGAN": "Building the digital blocks<br>for a new era of gaming",
      "TITLE": "BESPOKE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK",
      "TITLE_SUB": "For the gaming industry",
      "DESCRIPTION_01": "Since its inception, blockchain technology took the world by storm, and the cryptocurrency market cap reached $600 billion as of January 2018. While the coin market provided the driving force for such a revolution, other industries are also looking to embrace this phenomenon. Many analysts have been expecting the gaming industry to be the succeeding beneficiary. However, contrary to their belief, we have yet to see any surge in the gaming market.",
      "DESCRIPTION_02": "Our group has been studying and experimenting blockchain for years, and have come to the conclusion that existing blockchain projects cannot overcome the obstacles inherent in online gaming.",
      "DESCRIPTION_03": "As such, we are introducing a new bespoke blockchain network, the NCoin Network (NCN), tailor-made for the gaming industry."
    },
    "_DIFFERENCE": {
      "TITLE": "THE NCN DIFFERENCE",

      "VS_BITCOIN_DESCRIPTION": "While Bitcoin is the most widely known crypto currency in the market, it's high cost of transaction and lack of privacy makes it unsuitable for gaming transactions.

      "VS_ETHEREUM_MONERO": "VS<br>ETHEREUM, MONERO",
      "VS_ETHEREUM_MONERO_DESCRIPTION": "Ethereum and Monero are both Proof-of-Work crypto currencies. NCN's N-PoS will not only guarantee speeds higher than both, but will reward token holders with greater amounts, befitting of the high standards of the gaming industry.",

      "VS_NEO_CARDANO_DESCRIPTION": "Both Neo and Cardano are 2nd generation of crypto currencies that has gained recent popularity. NCN, with built-in Privacy and State Channel technology, is technologically more suited for gaming."
